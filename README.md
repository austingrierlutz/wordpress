WordPress Installation on VirtualMin

Simply transfer this script to the "/" directory on your VirtualMin server and run "sh install.sh" from the directory. 

IMPORTANT: Before transferring script, edit YOURDOMAIN to the virtual server you have already created. Ex. /home/YOURDOMAIN should now look like /home/test-server
